Creating and Using a Shared Library in Jenkins to Standardize Build.
Q3. Creating and Using a Shared Library in Jenkins to Standardize Build.

You are a DevOps engineer in a company managing multiple services. Each team writes their own Jenkinsfile, but all of them share a common set of actions:

Cloning the Git repository
Running unit tests
Deploying to a given environment
Instead of duplicating this logic in each Jenkinsfile, youâ€™ve been asked to create a Jenkins Shared Library to centralize and standardize.

Step 1: Create a New Git Repo for the Shared Library.

Step 2: Add Pipeline Logic in vars/ Folder example (commonBuild.groovy)

Groovy Sample code:

def call() {
    stage('Checkout') {
        checkout scm
    }
    stage('Unit Tests') {
        echo 'Running unit tests...'
        sh './gradlew test'
    }
}
Step 3: Register the Shared Library in Jenkins.

Step 4: Use the Shared Library in a Jenkinsfile.
